# Amazon.com-Price-Scraping

This repo is a simple web-scraping system in Python 3. The goal is to acquire the price of a given item on Amazon. This version, specifically, prints the price of corsair RAM.

Packages used are:
1. selenium
2. datetime

Files included:
1. An executable chromedriver application. This is needed for selenium to navigate the most recent iteration of google chrome.
2. The actual Code.

IMPORTANT:
Note that line 8 of ramcheck.py contains a path that should be altered to wherever your chromedriver is located.

Feel free to use and improve this code in whatever ways you see fit.
